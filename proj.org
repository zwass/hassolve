* Project
I will write a board game solving framework in Haskell. The primary
goal of the project will be to solve games to find out whether they
result in a "win", "lose", or "tie" for the first player. A secondary
goal is to provide an interface for playing solved games while
providing information about the values of moves.

This idea is inspired by work I did while in high school with the
[[http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/][Gamescrafters]] research group led by Dr. Dan Garcia at UC Berkeley.

I hope to leave the framework in a state that other Haskell developers
(perhaps future students in this course?) can continue using it to
explore the value of games. This will involve writing a solver that
can explore game trees agnostic of what game is being
played. Developers will write modules that plug into the framework in
order to describe board states, potential moves, and winning
scenarios. Using these functions, the solver will explore the tree and
return the results for each game.
